This server folder contains a working apache and MySQL (5.1.0).
You can launch the MySQL by double-clicking the bat file.
You can close the MySQL by pressing CTRL C and confirming with Y in the console.
You can launch the Apache by double-clicking the bat file.
You can close the Apache by double-clicking the bat file.

The default account registration page is in the htdocs folder.
You can delete that and put your own site there if desired.
If you'd wish to use my registration page for your repack,
Please leave credit in the footer as a token of your appreciation.

The settings are configured to only work within the _Server folder.
If you'd wish to change this you'd have to edit the following two files:
- _Server\apache\conf\httpd.conf
- _Server\mysql\bin\my.cnf
You can open these files with Notepad++. Then replace any '_Server' with 'your folder'.

I have spent a lot of work making the MySQL work flawlessly with Trinity.
If you do wish to use any part of this Server folder for your repack,
Please leave a credit in the .bat file. Whilst it is not visible to anyone,
It is still a nice token of your appreciation.

Thanks already, and with kind regards;
- Jordy Thery
